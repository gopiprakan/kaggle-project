Multi-Agent Customer Support Assistant — Project Overview

This project implements a simple but fully functional Multi-Agent Customer Support Assistant built for the Enterprise Agents track.
The purpose of this system is to demonstrate how multiple specialized agents can work together to automate a real business workflow—in this case, handling customer messages in a support environment.
Although the agents are lightweight and rule-based, the architecture clearly represents how multi-agent frameworks operate in enterprise settings: through specialization, coordination, and automated decision-making.

What This System Does

When a user sends a message (like “I need a refund” or “My invoice amount is wrong”), the system processes it using three different agents, each responsible for a specific task:

1. Intent Agent (Understands the Customer’s Message)

This agent analyzes the message and identifies its intent (refund, cancellation, billing issue, etc.) and urgency level (low, medium, high).
Even with simple rules, this agent demonstrates classification, routing, and task identification—core elements of enterprise automation.

2. Reply Agent (Generates a Professional Response)

Once the intent is identified, the Reply Agent produces a short, clean, professional customer support reply.
This simulates how enterprises use AI to draft emails, chat responses, and automated replies for customer tickets.

3. Escalation Agent (Decides When Human Support Is Needed)

Not every customer message can be solved automatically.
This agent checks urgency and intent, and determines whether the issue requires escalation to a human support agent.
It produces escalation notes and reasons—mirroring how real businesses prioritize and triage tickets.

4. Coordinator Agent (The “Brain” of the System)

The Coordinator receives the message, calls the three specialized agents, collects their outputs, and returns a complete response package containing:

The predicted intent

The urgency level

The auto-generated reply

The escalation decision

A clean JSON output

This shows how multi-agent systems rely on orchestration, not just isolated decision-making.

Why I Built This Project

For the Enterprise Agents track, Kaggle requires the demonstration of multi-agent collaboration applied to a business problem.
I chose customer support automation because:

1. It is a real and common enterprise workflow

Companies receive thousands of customer tickets every day.
Automating the first layer of classification and response can save businesses a lot of time.

2. Easy to understand and demonstrate

Agents in this notebook have clear responsibilities and predictable outputs.
Judges and users can easily see how each agent contributes to the final answer.

3. A perfect fit for multi-agent architecture

Customer support naturally splits into:

Understanding the message

Generating a reply

Making escalation decisions

This makes it ideal for demonstrating agent specialization.

4. Lightweight but practical

The project uses simple rule-based logic instead of heavy models, making it:

Fast to run

Easy to understand

Safe to execute without external API calls

But the structure is extensible—LLMs can replace each agent for more advanced versions.

5. Meets all Kaggle agent competition requirements

This notebook includes:

Multiple cooperative agents

Clear orchestration

A meaningful enterprise use case

Test cases that demonstrate the system

Clean code and simple architecture

How the Multi-Agent System Works
Step 1: User sends a message

Example: “I want to cancel my subscription.”

Step 2: Coordinator stores message in memory

This simulates persistent conversation and adds context.

Step 3: Intent Agent classifies the text

Intent → cancellation
Urgency → high

Step 4: Reply Agent generates response

“Please share your registered email so I can help cancel your subscription.”

Step 5: Escalation Agent decides

High urgency → escalate to human support

Step 6: Coordinator merges all outputs

Returns a clean JSON response.

This entire flow demonstrates how enterprise systems can split responsibilities across multiple automated components.

Why This Project Is Useful

Even though the system is simple, its real-world value is clear:

1. Fast customer response

The assistant drafts replies instantly.

2. Automatic triaging

Urgent messages are flagged without manual review.

3. Scalability

Many companies adopt similar architectures using LLMs, making this a small prototype of real enterprise tech.

4. Extendable

Each agent can be replaced later with a more advanced version using:

LLMs (Gemini, GPT)

Fine-tuned classifiers

Knowledge bases

APIs

This notebook demonstrates the structure without requiring heavy compute.

Conclusion

This project shows how multiple coordinated agents can automate enterprise workflows—specifically customer support ticket handling.
By separating the system into an Intent Agent, Reply Agent, Escalation Agent, and Coordinator, the notebook clearly demonstrates specialization, communication, and orchestration—all essential ideas in multi-agent systems used in real businesses.

Even in its simple form, this assistant illustrates practical automation strategies and serves as a foundation for more advanced enterprise-level agents.
The project is easy to understand, lightweight to run, and directly aligned with the goals of the Enterprise Agents track.
