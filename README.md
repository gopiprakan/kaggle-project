**AI Agents in Action: A Capstone Exploration**

The Multi-Agent Customer Support Assistant automates customer service conversations by distributing tasks across multiple intelligent AI agents. When a user sends a message, the Orchestrator Agent routes it through a series of specialized agents:
The Intent Classification Agent identifies what the user wants.
The Sentiment Analysis Agent evaluates the customer’s emotional tone.

The Knowledge Retrieval Agent extracts relevant information from a predefined knowledge base.
The Response Generation Agent creates a polished, helpful reply.
The Escalation Agent steps in when queries are too complex or sentiment is too negative.


This architecture allows the system to deliver precise, empathetic, and consistent responses. The use of multiple agents ensures modularity, scalability, and improved accuracy across tasks. The system closely imitates a real support team—each agent performs its job, and the orchestrator combines their work to serve the user efficiently.
